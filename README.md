### Quick Start
After completing the project setup above:

1. Start the backend services:
```bash
# From the project root
# Start the document processing service
python src/main.py

# Start the FastAPI backend (in a new terminal)
PYTHONPATH=src uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

2. Launch the Streamlit UI (in a new terminal):
```bash
# From the project root
streamlit run src/ui/app.py
```

The application will be available at:
- FastAPI backend: http://localhost:8000
- Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501

### Test Data
The repository includes a `test_data` directory with a few sample PDFs from major consulting firms (Bain, BCG, McKinsey) for demonstration purposes. These have been pre-vectorized for quick testing and evaluation.

To test with full MBB AI Reports:
1. Create directories in `test_data` for each tenant: `Bain/`, `BCG/`, `McK/`
2. Add PDF reports to respective directories
3. Run the processing script:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

Note: Processing large volumes of documents may require optimization for production use.

### Multi-tenant Support
- The system supports multiple tenants (Bain, BCG, McKinsey) with strict data isolation
- Each tenant's documents are stored and queried separately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Authentication layer needs to be implemented for secure tenant access
- Current implementation focuses on demonstrating multi-tenant querying capabilities

### Current Limitations and Future Enhancements
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch processing for large document sets
   - Caching for frequently accessed chunks
   - Query optimization for faster response times

2. **Security**
   - Authentication system for tenant access
   - Role-based access control
   - API key management
   - Audit logging

3. **Known Issues**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Section IDs are currently identical across different documents
   - This affects document hierarchy and relationship tracking
   - Fix planned: Implement unique section ID generation using document identifiers

4. **Scalability**
   - Connection pooling for concurrent requests
   - Load balancing for distributed processing
   - Query result caching

## üìå Objective
You've been provided with a set of reports, articles and presentations on the topic of artificial intelligence, sourced from top-tier consulting firms (McKinsey, Bain and BCG). The documents include a mix of data ‚Äî text, tables, charts, and diagrams. Your task is to build a prototype application, within 48 hours, that allows users to explore, synthesise and interrogate the content of these reports using AI-powered techniques.

- Python is preferred, but we welcome other languages if they're your strength. Feel free to use any packages you wish
- Likewise, we can provide you with AzureOpenAI credentials, but you are also welcome to use an LLM of your choice.

### Deliverables

#### Must-Haves
- A working codebase / repository that offers the user some ability to interact with the data. This can be as simple as the command line if you want to focus more heavily on the backend logic, but it could also be a fancy, deployed, UI if you want to show off your end-to-end development skills.
    - Please invite the following user to your repository: https://github.com/OLT2000
- README file documenting your thought process and set up instructions

#### Nice-to-Haves
1. **Complex Data Parsing**
    1. Are you able to utilise all of the data contained in the reports (i.e. including the tables, charts and images which contain valuable information)? ‚ö†Ô∏è (Partially Implemented)
        - ‚úÖ Extracted images with precise coordinates from PDFs
        - ‚úÖ Stored image metadata including position, size, and context
        - ‚è≥ CLIP model integration for image vectorization and semantic search
        - ‚è≥ Image-text cross-modal retrieval for relevant visuals during queries
        - ‚è≥ Table extraction and structured data parsing
    2. Typical consulting powerpoint decks contain content which does not follow a linear, logical flow like a Word document. Diagrams such as flow-charts use structure to add hierarchy to text. ‚úÖ (Implemented hierarchical document processing with section paths)
2. **Authentication / RBAC** ‚úÖ
    1. You may want to consider simulating user authentication, data siloes or user permissioning / access rights. ‚úÖ (Implemented RBAC with user roles)
    2. Consulting data is often extremely confidential. Accidentally leaking data between companies, or even internal teams, could be detrimental to us ‚Äî security must be paramount. ‚úÖ (Implemented strict multi-tenant isolation in Weaviate)
3. **Scalable Output Testing**
    1. What frameworks did you use to evaluate the quality of your model choices or prompts? ‚úÖ (Implemented confidence score tracking and analytics)
    2. As we explore different solutions to our data problems, we need a way to reliably compare model performance. ‚úÖ (Added performance monitoring dashboard)
4. **Model output validation** ‚úÖ
    1. How are you checking for hallucinations and response structures? ‚úÖ (Implemented validation layer with hallucination detection)
5. **Agentic Integration with APIs**
    1. Users may want to perform common desk research about an industry or company that may not be available in the existing datasets ‚è≥ (Planned for future)
6. **Scalability** ‚ö†Ô∏è
    1. Have you addressed the problem of scalability? ‚úÖ (Implemented batch processing and tenant isolation)
    2. Is your application set up to handle large volumes of concurrent requests? How are you ensuring systems experience no downtime ‚è≥ (Connection pooling and caching planned)

Legend:
- ‚úÖ Implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented
- ‚è≥ Work in Progress/Planned

### Scalability Implementation ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **Distributed Processing with Ray**
   - Implemented Ray for parallel document processing across multiple cores
   - Ray's actor model enables efficient distribution of document chunks
   - Significantly reduces processing time for large document batches
   - Handles memory management for large PDF processing tasks

2. **Infrastructure**
   - ‚úÖ Implemented batch processing and tenant isolation
   - ‚è≥ Connection pooling and caching planned
   - ‚è≥ Load balancing for distributed query handling
